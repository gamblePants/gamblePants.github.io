# gamblePants.github.io

This repository was initialy created for the purpose of hosting images for my readme.md files on GitHub. I will now also be using this repo to host static test websites (html, css and javascript).

## Insctructions for how to use GitHub Pages to host images:

- Create a new repository called (yourUserName).github.io
- Create a simple index.html file and upload it to to the repo
- Test it is working by going to https://(username).github.io
- If you can view the html file it should be all set up

- Now create a folder in the repo called img
- (You may wish to use a different folder structure)
- Upload an image to the folder
- In the above example I uploaded an image called gitHub_Pages_01.PNG
- Use the following syntax to call the image when you edit your readme.md file:

```

```
