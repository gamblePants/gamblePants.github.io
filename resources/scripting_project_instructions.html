<h1>Instructions</h1>
  <p>
  You have been tasked with applying some additional functionality to a website. The site needs to be multipage one you have created previously. These tasks must be completed in such as way as to ensure the content is still accessible and usable to all. In other words, it needs to 	&#8216;degrade gracefully&#8217;.</p>
  <p>Your site will  be checked against IE/Edge, Chrome, Firefox and mobile devices - so you do need to focus heavily on cross-browser and cross-device issues.</p>
  <p>You are required to add the functionality using JavaScript to your site. </p>
  <div id="mark"> <span class="emph" id="note">Note: marking scale for this assessment - </span>
  <ul>
	<li>To Pass this assessment you must <strong>complete</strong> five listed code items <span class="emph">and</span> include:
		<ul>
			<li>Appropriate comments that show your understanding of the code</li>
			<li><strong>A list of completed tasks in a separate text file in the root of your folder </strong>(see below).</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	
  </ul>
 </div>
  <p>As mentioned above, make sure you place appropriate comments in your code - <span class="emph">this is mandatory</span> - one of the competency elements requires technical documentation. This method is preferable to you having to write up an entirely new document explaining each script in painstaking detail.</p>
    <p>You must include a simple text file in your final submission listing the numbers and purpose of each of the scripts attempted. Also, if you include any scripts and features outside of this list, include their details in this file.</p>
  <p>Any code not written by yourself must be credited. Plugging in code written by someone else (other than a classmate) is fine. Just give the author credit, and justify why you used it.</p>
  <p>Image galleries can be as simple or as complicated as you choose. Remember that the main thing is the script works correctly, rather than its visual impact.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Validate the form on your contact page. Ensure that all text has content, and that the content conforms to requirements (you decide and document what those requirements are). </li>
	<li>When the form has been validated, show a confirm dialog box that displays the data entered and asks the user if that data entered is correct. If yes, thank the visitor and submit the form. If no, prevent the form from submitting so users can go back and make adjustments where necessary. Ensure the form fields remain populated with data.</li>
    
    <li> Add the functionality to a page that allows the user to select from a number of customer reviews, so that they only need to see what they want to see. You can use any selection device you choose (e.g. combo box, list of links, table etc.). When the user selects an item, the title, picture and content of the review should change to match the selection.</li>
    <li> Add functionality that allows the user to enter the name of an item into a search field. As they type, a list of possible matches should appear. The user can select an item on the list to place it into the search textbox. </li>
    <li>Change the displayed product/service on your page when the user clicks on an item in the list. This can only be implemented if the item above has also been implemented .</li>
    <li>As an alternative to above, dynamically build a table that contains a list of products/services that a user enters into the search textbox. This would be done when the user clicks the search button. If there are no products matching the entered term, a message informing the user that no matches have been found should be displayed in the page (not in an alert box).</li>
    <li>Create an image gallery that allows the user to move through a selection of recommended products/services. The user should be able to move backwards and forward through the selection.</li>
	<li>On any part of your site, insert a canvas element and apply an appropriate animation or graphic.</li>   
    <li>Modify one of your pages, so that latest news items or reviews are listed by headline only (show/hide effect). When a headline is selected, a story should open underneath it (pushing all the other headlines down).</li>
	<li>Provide code for a Login feature. Once the user logs in successfully, every page of the site will display the user's login name, along with a link allowing them to logout at any time. You can achieve this by either utilising Ajax, or hardcoding a username and password into a basic JavaScript routine. You will need to use cookies to maintain a logged in state across all pages of the website.</li>
    <li> If the user has logged in, and they decide to fill out the Enquiry form, automatically fill in the Name and Email fields when the user loads the contact.htm page.</li>
  </ol>
